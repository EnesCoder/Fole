# Fole
A "file manager" that has colors so it is cool

# Tutorial
I think you have problems if you want to try this as your main file manager, bÄ±t I would be happy if you did.

So here is a tutorial:

w - go up
s - go down
b - go to the parent directory
a - add entry
d - delete entry
r - rename or move entry
q - quit
