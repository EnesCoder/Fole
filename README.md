# Fole
A "file manager" that has colors so it is cool

# Tutorial
I think you have problems if you want to try this as your main file manager, bÄ±t I would be happy if you did.

So here is a tutorial:

w - go up

s - go down

b - go to the parent directory

a - add entry

d - delete entry

r - rename or move entry

q - quit

# Warning
This "file manager" has lots of issues, if you care. I may update it if I am not lazy, but for now you may not want to use it daily.
What I mean by issues are:

- Too many entries, it will go beyond the terminal and you won't be able to see them
I forgot the others
